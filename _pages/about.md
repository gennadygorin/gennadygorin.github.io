I am a Senior Scientist, Computational Biology at <a href='https://www.faunabio.com/'>Fauna Bio</a>, a biotech startup leveraging non-model system biology to improve human health. I received my Ph.D. from the <a href='http://pachterlab.github.io/'>Pachter Laboratory</a> at Caltech, establishing foundational theory, tools, and methods for genomics and biophysics. 

As an academic and industry researcher, I have combined bioinformatics and physics to improve single-cell analyses and innovate active pipelines for therapeutic discovery. I am excited to use the depth of my interdisciplinary background to develop revolutionary methods for single-cell biology, putting my team at the forefront of the industry and enabling research that changes lives for the better.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
