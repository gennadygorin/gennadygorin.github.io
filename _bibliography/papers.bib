	abstract = {The chemical master equation (CME), which describes the discrete and stochastic molecule number dynamics associated with biological processes like transcription, is difficult to solve analytically. It is particularly hard to solve for models involving bursting/gene switching, a biological feature that tends to produce heavy-tailed single cell RNA counts distributions. In this paper, we present a novel method for computing exact and analytic solutions to the CME in such cases, and use these results to explore approximate solutions valid in different parameter regimes, and to compute observables of interest. Our method leverages tools inspired by quantum mechanics, including ladder operators and Feynman-like diagrams, and establishes close formal parallels between the dynamics of bursty transcription, and the dynamics of bosons interacting with a single fermion. We focus on two problems: (i) the chemical birth-death process coupled to a switching gene/the telegraph model, and (ii) a model of transcription and multistep splicing involving a switching gene and an arbitrary number of downstream splicing steps. We work out many special cases, and exhaustively explore the special functionology associated with these problems. This is Part I in a two-part series of papers; in Part II, we explore an alternative solution approach that is more useful for numerically solving these problems, and apply it to parameter inference on simulated RNA counts data.},

Here we introduce a stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for modeling detailed transcriptional kinetics in prokaryotic systems, which has not been solved analytically. The model includes stochastic two-state gene activation, mRNA synthesis initiation and stepwise elongation, release to the cytoplasm, and stepwise co-transcriptional degradation. Using the Gillespie algorithm, the platform simulates nascent and mature mRNA kinetics of a single gene copy and predicts fluorescent signals measurable by time-lapse single-cell mRNA imaging, for different experimental conditions. To approach the inverse problem of estimating the kinetic parameters of the model from experimental data, we develop a heuristic optimization method based on the genetic algorithm and the empirical distribution of mRNA generated by simulation. As a demonstration, we show that the optimization algorithm can successfully recover the transcriptional kinetics of simulated and experimental gene expression data. The platform is available as a MATLAB software package at https://data.caltech.edu/records/1287.},

	abstract = {The advent of high-throughput transcriptomics provides an opportunity to advance mechanistic understanding of transcriptional processes and their connections to cellular function at an unprecedented, genome-wide scale. These transcriptional systems, which involve discrete stochastic events, are naturally modeled using chemical master equations (CMEs), which can be solved for probability distributions to fit biophysical rates that govern system dynamics. While CME models have been used as standards in fluorescence transcriptomics for decades to analyze single-species RNA distributions, there are often no closed-form solutions to CMEs that model multiple species, such as nascent and mature RNA transcript counts. This has prevented the application of standard likelihood-based statistical methods for analyzing high-throughput, multi-species transcriptomic datasets using biophysical models. Inspired by recent work in machine learning to learn solutions to complex dynamical systems, we leverage neural networks and statistical understanding of system distributions to produce accurate approximations to a steady-state bivariate distribution for a model of the RNA life cycle that includes nascent and mature molecules. The steady-state distribution to this simple model has no closed-form solution and requires intensive numerical solving techniques: our approach reduces likelihood evaluation time by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate two approaches, whereby solutions are approximated by 1) learning the weights of kernel distributions with constrained parameters or 2) learning both weights and scaling factors for parameters of kernel distributions. We show that our strategies, denoted by kernel weight regression and parameter-scaled kernel weight regression, respectively, enable broad exploration of parameter space and can be used in existing likelihood frameworks to infer transcriptional burst sizes, RNA splicing rates, and mRNA degradation rates from experimental transcriptomic data.},

            The question of how cell-to-cell differences in transcription rate affect RNA count distributions is fundamental for understanding biological processes underlying transcription. Answering this question requires quantitative models that are both interpretable (describing concrete biophysical phenomena) and tractable (amenable to mathematical analysis). This enables the identification of experiments which best discriminate between competing hypotheses. As a proof of principle, we introduce a simple but flexible class of models involving a continuous stochastic transcription rate driving a discrete RNA transcription and splicing process, and compare and contrast two biologically plausible hypotheses about transcription rate variation. One assumes variation is due to DNA experiencing mechanical strain, while the other assumes it is due to regulator number fluctuations. We introduce a framework for numerically and analytically studying such models, and apply Bayesian model selection to identify candidate genes that show signatures of each model in single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse glutamatergic neurons.},

However, current methods for determining cell types or ‘clusters’ in multimodal data often rely on ad hoc approaches to balance or integrate measurements, and assumptions ignoring inherent properties of the data. To enable interpretable and consistent cell cluster determination, we present meK-means (mechanistic K-means) which integrates modalities through a unifying model of transcription to learn underlying, shared biophysical states. With meK-means we can cluster cells with nascent and mature mRNA measurements, utilizing the causal, physical relationships between these modalities. This identifies shared transcription dynamics across cells, which induce the observed molecule counts, and provides an alternative definition for ‘clusters’ through the governing parameters of cellular processes.},
