	abstract = {The chemical master equation (CME), which describes the discrete and stochastic molecule number dynamics associated with biological processes like transcription, is difficult to solve analytically. It is particularly hard to solve for models involving bursting/gene switching, a biological feature that tends to produce heavy-tailed single cell RNA counts distributions. In this paper, we present a novel method for computing exact and analytic solutions to the CME in such cases, and use these results to explore approximate solutions valid in different parameter regimes, and to compute observables of interest. Our method leverages tools inspired by quantum mechanics, including ladder operators and Feynman-like diagrams, and establishes close formal parallels between the dynamics of bursty transcription, and the dynamics of bosons interacting with a single fermion. We focus on two problems: (i) the chemical birth-death process coupled to a switching gene/the telegraph model, and (ii) a model of transcription and multistep splicing involving a switching gene and an arbitrary number of downstream splicing steps. We work out many special cases, and exhaustively explore the special functionology associated with these problems. This is Part I in a two-part series of papers; in Part II, we explore an alternative solution approach that is more useful for numerically solving these problems, and apply it to parameter inference on simulated RNA counts data.},

Here we introduce a stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for modeling detailed transcriptional kinetics in prokaryotic systems, which has not been solved analytically. The model includes stochastic two-state gene activation, mRNA synthesis initiation and stepwise elongation, release to the cytoplasm, and stepwise co-transcriptional degradation. Using the Gillespie algorithm, the platform simulates nascent and mature mRNA kinetics of a single gene copy and predicts fluorescent signals measurable by time-lapse single-cell mRNA imaging, for different experimental conditions. To approach the inverse problem of estimating the kinetic parameters of the model from experimental data, we develop a heuristic optimization method based on the genetic algorithm and the empirical distribution of mRNA generated by simulation. As a demonstration, we show that the optimization algorithm can successfully recover the transcriptional kinetics of simulated and experimental gene expression data. The platform is available as a MATLAB software package at https://data.caltech.edu/records/1287.},

These can be solved for microstate probabilities over time and state space for a better understanding of biological rates and system dynamics. However, closed form solutions to CMEs are available in only the simplest cases. Probing systems of higher complexity is challenging due to the computational cost of finding solutions and often compromises accuracy by treating infinite systems as finite. We use statistical understanding of system behavior and the generalizability of neural networks to approximate steady-state joint distribution solutions for a two-species model of the life cycle of RNA. We define a set of kernel functions using moments of the system and learn optimal weights for kernel functions with a neural network trained to minimize statistical distance between approximated and numerically calculated distributions. We show that this method of kernel weight regression (KWR) approximation is as accurate as lower-order generating-function solutions to the system, but faster; KWR approximation reduces the time for likelihood evaluation by several orders of magnitude. KWR also generalizes to produce probability predictions for system rates outside of training sets, thereby enabling efficient transcriptional parameter exploration and system analysis.},

            The question of how cell-to-cell differences in transcription rate affect RNA count distributions is fundamental for understanding biological processes underlying transcription. Answering this question requires quantitative models that are both interpretable (describing concrete biophysical phenomena) and tractable (amenable to mathematical analysis). This enables the identification of experiments which best discriminate between competing hypotheses. As a proof of principle, we introduce a simple but flexible class of models involving a continuous stochastic transcription rate driving a discrete RNA transcription and splicing process, and compare and contrast two biologically plausible hypotheses about transcription rate variation. One assumes variation is due to DNA experiencing mechanical strain, while the other assumes it is due to regulator number fluctuations. We introduce a framework for numerically and analytically studying such models, and apply Bayesian model selection to identify candidate genes that show signatures of each model in single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse glutamatergic neurons.},

This creates opportunities for transcriptome-wide, mechanistic studies of cellular processing in heterogeneous cell types, with applications ranging from inferring kinetic differences between cells, to the role of stochasticity in driving heterogeneity. However, current methods for determining cell types or ‘clusters’ present in multimodal data often rely on ad hoc or independent treatment of modalities, and assumptions ignoring inherent properties of the count data. To enable interpretable and consistent cell cluster determination from multimodal data, we present meK-Means (mechanistic K-Means) which integrates modalities and learns underlying, shared biophysical states through a unifying model of transcription. In particular, we demonstrate how meK-Means can be used to cluster cells from unspliced and spliced mRNA count modalities. By utilizing the causal, physical relationships underlying these modalities, we identify shared transcriptional kinetics across cells, which induce the observed gene expression profiles, and provide an alternative definition for 'clusters' through the governing parameters of cellular processes.},
